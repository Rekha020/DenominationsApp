This is a Console application to calculate denominations that gets two inputs and outputs 
the resukt according to the input provided

Input1 : this has to be the amount that user pays
Input2 : this is the actual price of product

If both the inputs are valid  then the result will show denominations of return amount
If amount is lesser that price of product, application will show a message that amount is lesser
If the amount and price of product are equal, application will show a message that return amount is zero

Notes:  Amount from user should be greated than or equal to Rs1
        Price of product can/cannot be a float value following 50ps

There is a test project in this solution that tests the method CalculateDenominations of class Denominations
It tests the expected values of the method
